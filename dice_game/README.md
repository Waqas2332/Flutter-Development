# Flutter Basics 1

Designing UI is all about combining widgets <br>

Scaffold Widget gives a primary layout to the whole screen <br>

Dart is Object Oriented Language ( Each value is an object at the end ) <br>

For making a variable accepting null, use ? with variable type such as int? <br>

const & final are almost same but const accepts value at compile time but final is manipulated at run time <br>
